# Edge-AI-Powered-Real-Time-Sepsis-Prediction-with-Secure-Multi-Sensor-Fusion-for-ICU-Care

##  Project Overview
Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires early detection and rapid intervention to reduce mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Traditional monitoring systems rely on periodic assessments and cloud-based processing, which introduce critical delays and privacy concerns.

This project presents an **Edge-AI based real-time sepsis prediction system** that continuously monitors patient vital signs using multiple sensors, fuses the data locally, and predicts sepsis risk directly at the bedside. The system ensures **low latency, secure data handling, and timely alerts** to assist clinicians in critical decision-making.

---

##  Problem Statement
Delayed diagnosis of sepsis in ICUs leads to increased mortality due to:
-  Periodic and manual vital sign monitoring  
-  Latency in cloud-dependent systems  
-  Patient data privacy and security concerns  
-  Overburdened healthcare staff  

 There is a strong need for a **real-time, secure, and intelligent bedside monitoring solution.**

---

##  Proposed Solution
Our solution leverages **Edge AI** and **secure wireless multi-sensor fusion** to:
-  Continuously collect physiological data  
-  Perform real-time sepsis risk prediction locally  
-  Trigger early alerts for clinicians  
-  Preserve patient data privacy  

The system acts as an assistive **early-warning tool**, not a replacement for clinical diagnosis.
